Consolidating Arch Linux Packages for Custom Install

AS

I am creating a custom Arch Linux system and need to find out which packages I need to add to a pure Arch installation with KDE Plasma desktop. The installed_packages.txt file is a list of all packages I have installed on my current workstation. The packages.txt file is a list of packages installed on fresh pure Arch install with KDE Plasma. Please compare the two file lists and consolidate them into a single file while removing redundant, repeated, or different versions of the same package. Separate them into subcategories like Games, System Utilities, Office Software, etc. Then print the final result in a code text block.

I'll help you consolidate the packages from both lists, removing duplicates and organizing them into categories. I'll use the packages.txt as a base and add unique packages from installed_packages.txt.

Consolidated Arch Linux Package List

Click to open document

I've consolidated the packages from both lists, removing duplicates and organizing them into meaningful categories. A few notes:

- I prioritized packages from the pure Arch install (packages.txt) as the base
- Added unique and interesting packages from installed_packages.txt
- Categorized packages based on their primary function
- Removed redundant or very similar packages
- Kept a mix of core system packages and useful applications

Would you like me to explain the categorization or make any adjustments to the list?

Please create an post-install script to install the Chaotic AUR repository using the following instructions:

Setup * We start by retrieving the primary key to enable the installation of our keyring and mirror list:

Copy

`pacman-key --recv-key 3056513887B78AEB --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com pacman-key --lsign-key 3056513887B78AEB pacman -U 'https://cdn-mirror.chaotic.cx/chaotic-aur/chaotic-keyring.pkg.tar.zst' pacman -U 'https://cdn-mirror.chaotic.cx/chaotic-aur/chaotic-mirrorlist.pkg.tar.zst' Copy`

Then, we append (adding at the end) the following to _/etc/pacman.conf_:

Copy

`[chaotic-aur] Include = /etc/pacman.d/chaotic-mirrorlist`

I'll create a post-install script to set up the Chaotic AUR repository with error handling and safety checks.

Chaotic AUR Repository Setup Script

Click to open code

This script includes several key features:

- Checks for root/sudo privileges
- Verifies internet connectivity before attempting to download
- Retrieves and signs the Chaotic AUR key
- Downloads and installs the keyring and mirrorlist
- Updates pacman.conf with the Chaotic AUR repository
- Creates a backup of the original pacman.conf
- Includes error handling and informative messages
- Optional package list refresh

To use the script:

1. Save it to a file (e.g., `setup-chaotic-aur.sh`)
2. Make it executable: `chmod +x setup-chaotic-aur.sh`
3. Run with sudo: `sudo ./setup-chaotic-aur.sh`

Would you like me to modify anything about the script?

Add functionality to the script to install the AthenaOS repository using the following instructions:

The declaration of Athena repository is defined inside `/etc/pacman.conf` as:

Copy

`[athena]`

SigLevel = Optional TrustedOnly Include = /etc/pacman.d/athena-mirrorlist In Athena, the repository keys and related files, `athena.gpg`, `athena-trusted`, `athena-revoked`, `chaotic.gpg`, `chaotic-trusted` and `chaotic-revoked` files are stored in `/usr/share/pacman/keyrings/` folder. `athena.gpg` file is the public key needed to be imported in order to access to Athena repository, `athena-trusted` contains the keys to trust, and `athena-revoked` contains the list of revoked keys in long format. This operation is managed by the installer that will initialize all the keys stored in `/usr/share/pacman/keyrings/` folder. **Installation** If you wish to use Athena repository in a different operating system, you can do this by adding the following to your **/etc/pacman.conf**:

Copy

`[athena]`

SigLevel = Optional TrustedOnly Include = /etc/pacman.d/athena-mirrorlist Get the mirrorlist file by running:

Copy

`sudo curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Athena-OS/athena/main/packages/os-specific/athena-mirrorlist/athena-mirrorlist -o /etc/pacman.d/athena-mirrorlist`

On the terminal, execute:

Copy

`sudo pacman-key --recv-keys A3F78B994C2171D5 --keyserver keys.openpgp.org`

**Tip** If it is not working, try:

Copy

`sudo pacman-key --recv-keys A3F78B994C2171D5 --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com`

Finally, trust the imported key by:

Copy

`sudo pacman-key --lsign A3F78B994C2171D5`

I'll update the previous script to include functionality for setting up the AthenaOS repository alongside the Chaotic AUR repository.

Chaotic AUR and AthenaOS Repository Setup Script

Click to open code

The updated script now includes:

- Functionality to set up both Chaotic AUR and AthenaOS repositories
- Checks for multiple keyservers when importing the Athena repository key
- Improved error handling and internet connectivity checks
- Optional package list refresh
- Backup of pacman.conf
- Checks to prevent duplicate repository entries

To use the script:

1. Save it to a file (e.g., `setup-repositories.sh`)
2. Make it executable: `chmod +x setup-repositories.sh`
3. Run with sudo: `sudo ./setup-repositories.sh`

The script will:

- Retrieve and import keys for both repositories
- Download necessary mirrorlist files
- Update `/etc/pacman.conf` with repository configurations
- Refresh package lists

Would you like me to modify anything about the script?

Now create a post-install script that will first call on the setup-repositories.sh script, then use a combination of pacman and paru to install the packages from the new packages.txt file from the beginning steps. Note: protonvpn and proton-bridges are built using a PKGBUILD file. Ollama can be installed using `curl -fsSL https://**ollama**.com/install.sh | sh`, and I want my aliases for oh-my-zsh to be used (the file is attached). Additionally, to install Docker Desktop, use the following official instructions and add it to the script. Then print the final post-install script in a code text block.

I'll create a comprehensive post-install script that incorporates all the requirements you've mentioned.

Arch Linux Post-Installation Setup Script

Click to open code

The post-install script includes:

1. Repository setup using the previously created script
2. Package installation via pacman and paru
3. Ollama installation
4. Docker Desktop installation
5. Oh My Zsh aliases setup

To use the script:

1. Ensure you have `setup-repositories.sh`, `aliases.zsh`, and this script in the same directory
2. Make it executable: `chmod +x post-install-script.sh`
3. Run with sudo: `sudo ./post-install-script.sh`

A few notes and recommendations:

- The script requires network connectivity
- It assumes you're running as a user with sudo privileges
- Docker Desktop installation might need additional manual configuration
- Customize the package lists as needed

Create a README.md detailing the entirety of the scripts and how to use them. My handle is CypherOxide on GitHub and my system will be called ErisOS

ErisOS Installation and Setup Guide

The README provides a comprehensive guide to the ErisOS installation process, explaining each script's purpose, usage instructions, and key features. I've styled it to be informative, professional, and reflective of a personal Linux distribution project.

The license for the README.md will be the MIT license

I'll update the README.md to include the MIT license.

I've added the full MIT License text to the README, replacing the previous placeholder. The license is now properly attributed to CypherOxide and covers the entire ErisOS project. The MIT License is a permissive open-source license that allows for wide use, modification, and distribution, with the primary requirement of preserving the original copyright notice.
